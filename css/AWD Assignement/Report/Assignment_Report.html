        <h3>1. Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This report documents the design and implementation of a modern, responsive personal portfolio website developed as part of the Advanced Web Development course. The project demonstrates proficiency in core web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6+ to create a professional online presence showcasing skills, projects, and contact information. The portfolio employs contemporary design principles, advanced animations, and interactive features to deliver an engaging user experience across all devices.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>2. Technologies and Tools Used</h3>
        <p><strong>HTML5:</strong> The website utilizes semantic HTML5 elements including &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; to create a well-structured, accessible document. Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) and ARIA attributes enhance accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies.</p>
        
        <p><strong>CSS3:</strong> Advanced styling implemented through CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for maintainable theming, CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible responsive layouts, keyframe animations and transitions for smooth visual effects, media queries for responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop), and gradient backgrounds with glassmorphism effects for modern aesthetics.</p>
        
        <p><strong>JavaScript ES6+:</strong> Client-side interactivity powered by modern JavaScript features including DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates, Event listeners for user interactions, localStorage API for theme preference persistence, Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered animations, form validation with real-time feedback, and smooth scrolling with custom easing functions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>3. Design Choices and Rationale</h3>
        <p><strong>Color Palette:</strong> A contemporary purple primary color (#6C63FF) was selected as the main accent, complemented by coral (#FF6584) and cyan (#00D4FF) for visual hierarchy and call-to-action elements. This vibrant yet professional palette appeals to tech-focused audiences while maintaining accessibility standards with sufficient contrast ratios.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Typography:</strong> The design employs Poppins, a geometric sans-serif font, for body text ensuring excellent readability across devices. Playfair Display, an elegant serif typeface, is used for headings to create visual contrast and sophistication. Font sizes scale responsively using relative units (rem, em) for optimal legibility.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Layout Strategy:</strong> A mobile-first responsive approach ensures optimal performance on smaller devices first, progressively enhancing for larger screens. CSS Grid handles major page sections for two-dimensional layouts, while Flexbox manages component-level arrangements. This combination provides maximum flexibility and browser compatibility.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Visual Style:</strong> The design follows contemporary minimalist principles with generous whitespace, clean lines, and focused content hierarchy. Subtle glassmorphism effects (backdrop-filter blur) add depth without overwhelming content. Smooth animations and transitions enhance user engagement without sacrificing performance.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>4. Key Features Implemented</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Theme Toggle:</strong> Dark/light mode switcher with localStorage persistence ensures user preferences are remembered across sessions. CSS custom properties enable instant theme switching without page reloads.</li>
            <li><strong>Smooth Navigation:</strong> JavaScript-powered smooth scrolling with custom easing provides fluid navigation between sections. Active section highlighting in the navigation bar improves user orientation.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Typing Effect:</strong> Hero section features an animated typing effect cycling through multiple professional roles, creating immediate visual interest and demonstrating JavaScript animation capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Skill Visualization:</strong> Interactive progress bars animate on scroll using Intersection Observer, providing engaging visual representation of technical proficiencies with smooth fill animations.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Showcase:</strong> Grid-based project cards with hover-activated overlays reveal detailed descriptions and links. CSS transforms create 3D lift effects enhancing interactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Form Validation:</strong> Contact form includes client-side validation with real-time feedback, animated error messages, and visual success states, demonstrating proper form UX patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Scroll Animations:</strong> Intersection Observer API triggers fade-in and slide-in animations as elements enter the viewport, creating a dynamic scrolling experience without performance penalties.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Navigation:</strong> Mobile-optimized hamburger menu with smooth slide-in animation transforms into a horizontal navigation bar on larger screens.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>5. Responsive Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            The website adopts a mobile-first development approach with seven responsive breakpoints (360px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1200px, 1400px, and 1920px) ensuring optimal presentation across the full spectrum of devices from smartphones to 4K displays. CSS Grid's auto-fit and minmax functions create fluid layouts that adapt without explicit breakpoint definitions where possible. Flexible images use max-width: 100% and height: auto to scale proportionally. Touch targets on mobile meet accessibility guidelines with minimum 44x44px dimensions. The navigation system transforms from a space-efficient hamburger menu on mobile to a full horizontal navigation bar on desktop, optimizing usability for each context.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>6. Challenges and Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Theme Transition Smoothness:</strong> Initial implementation caused jarring color changes. Solution: CSS custom properties combined with transition: all 0.3s ease created smooth color interpolation across all themed elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Animation Performance:</strong> Complex animations caused frame drops on lower-end devices. Solution: Utilized CSS transforms and opacity (GPU-accelerated properties) instead of position/dimension changes, and implemented requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript animations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> Certain modern CSS features lacked universal support. Solution: Implemented progressive enhancement with fallbacks, used autoprefixer for vendor prefixes, and tested extensively across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.
        </p>
